Archimedean Copula Models Under Misspecification"

# Abstract
Copulas have become increasingly popular in multivariate statistics and financial applications.
This paper studies the effect of misspecification among the three Archimedean copula
families Frank, Gumbel, and Clayton on the dependence parameter estimation for two dimensions.
In addition to the maximum likelihood estimator and the inverted Kendall's tau
estimator, a p-value weighted average of the two is proposed and studied. To assess the performance
of the proposed estimator, a comprehensive simulation study was conducted. As
opposed to ML, the suggested estimator is shown to yield unbiased results even under copula
misspecification for certain combinations of true copula, misspecified copula and dependence
level. In the given application of estimating the Value-at-Risk of two bivariate portfolios
using the three Archimedean copulas in combination with each of the three estimators, the
proposed estimator also outperformed the ML estimator on the whole.
